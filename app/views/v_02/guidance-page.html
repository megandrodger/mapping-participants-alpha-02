  How to decide which digital category a research participant
</h3>
<p>During a research session you must draw out information about the participant that helps you place them in different categories. Below are a list of questions and activities that you could chose from to incorporate into a research session that will help expose confidence or skills.</p>

<p><span class="heading-medium" style="color: #005DA6; font-size: 21px;">Activity</span></br>
Send your participant their consent form attached to an email. In the session ask them to download, fill it out, and attach it to an email to send back.</span></br><span class="form-hint" style: "margin-top: 10px";>This could be helpful if your service doesn’t involved any complex interactions. Though a lot of users are comfortable with email, the understanding of downloading, and finding it on the computer to attach it might expose a lack of confidence, or hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span class="heading-medium" style="color: #00823B; font-size: 21px;">Question</span></br>
Will you talk me through how you use your phone, day to day?</br><span class="form-hint">Though this question is device specific, if the user mentions apps, online banking or listening to podcasts it might help understand their attitude towards technology.</span></p>

<p><span class="heading-medium" style="color: #00823B; font-size: 21px;">Question</span></br>
How much do you use your computer; is it mainly for work, social arrangement, or entertainment?</br><span class="form-hint">If the user works with computers at their work, they may be comfortable with specific skills but how they use their technology in their free time might help decide between ‘task specific’ and ‘basic skills’ categories</span></p>

<p><span class="heading-medium" style="color: #005DA6; font-size: 21px;">Activity</span></br>
Ask your participant to save a bookmark, and then return to it later in the session.</br><span class="form-hint">Using this would be dependent on what your service is, where it might work is  if there is any source of information that the user might be able to refer to, or if there are different sections of the prototype that they could switch between.</span></p>

<p><span class="heading-medium" style="color: #005DA6; font-size: 21px;">Activity</span></br>
Ask your participant to change a setting on their browser</br><span class="form-hint">For example to increase the text size in the page, or to use a different browser. This may reveal the difference between someone who is comfortable trying a new digital activity or someone who has a lower level of confidence</span></p>
